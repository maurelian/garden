title: Maurelian's Digital Garden
---

Hi!

Maurelian here. For sometime now I've been keeping a private digital garden, and I occasionally make some pretty nice notes.

This public garden is an experimental space, where I publish notes along the areas of my professional interest, which roughly correspond to:

- [[Smart contract security]]
- [[Solidity and the EVM]]
- [[Engineering practices]]
- [[Deep Work]]
